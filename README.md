## Record of algorithms in classroom

## Fibonacci Series
### Concept
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then continues as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

### Approach
Recursion

### Complexities
#### Time
O(n<sup>2</sup>)

#### Space
O(n)

## Prime Number
### Concept
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

### Approach
Sieve of Eratosthenes

### Complexities
#### Time
O(log(log n))

#### Space
O(n)

## Euler's Totient Function
### Concept
Euler's totient function, aka Î¦(n), is a function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

### Approach
Sieve of Eratosthenes.

### Complexities
#### Time
O(n(log(n)))

#### Space
O(n)
